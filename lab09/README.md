# Lab 09: Compiling Funny

[[RU](README.ru.md)|EN]

The goal of this lab is to create the Funny compiler that targets Wasm.

## Goal

In this lab we will extend the front-end built in [previous lab](../lab08/README.md) with the backend producing Wasm code.

The code itself is going to be relatively straightforward. Note the following:

1. The variable references should be replaced by their indices in the function variable list.
   [Lab 05](../lab05/README.md) does partially handle this in regard to the function arguments.
   The local variables in Wasm are added to the same list as the parameters, i.e. in a function of 2 arguments local number 2 refers to the first local variable, 3 to the second one and so on. Assignment to a local var is done with the [`local.set`][local.set] instruction.
2. Funny language treats the return values of the function as the regular variables; so they should also be registered in the Wasm function header as locals.
3. At the end of the function we need to put the return values to the stack

## Tasks

1. Implement the `compileModule()` function that converts the Funny module into a WebAssembly module in [compiler.ts](src/compiler.ts).
